I truely love my career and I owe everyting to my education. I've grown to attain two graduate level degrees. It's safe to say that I love school, but that wasn't always the case. 

My home life was not the most stable toward the end of high school, and there were no adult figures around me in that moment to help guide me. At that time my life revolved around soccer and playing video games with my friends. I wasn't good enough to play soccer in college, and I certainly didn't have the grades to get into a good school. Everything was in such disarray that I never took the SAT or ACT. I was lost.

Not knowing what to do next, my mother pointed me at the local junior college. Who knew you could flunk out if you don't show up for classes? At this point, I saw my peers having so much fun at their respective universities. While my motivations were misplaced, I went back to my junior college, fixed all my grades, and successfully transferred to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

I went to school to have _fun_, and my computer science classes were fun; my other courses were not. A fraternity was not something I initially set out to join, but at SIUE it was where all the social fun took place. The decision to join [ΦΚΨ](https://www.phikappapsi.com/) turned out to be the first pivital decision in my life. Of course I didnt realize it right away, but some of the other guys in my chapter saw something in me that I didn't see in myself.

Up until this point, I wasn't a leader and I had no interest in leadership. A friend in my fraternity discretely told me he was going to nominate me for our chapter's president, and I was stunned when I was elected. It was one thing to participate in a group, and something completely different when you're responsible for the actions of an organization. Sure I made mistakes, but I learned from the experience and discovered I enjoyed leadership. The willingness to jump in and guide a group to take on a challenge followed me to this day.

By the time I graduated with my computer science degree, I was _done_ with programming. My first few interviews did not go well, and once again, I felt lost. It was now when the next pivital decision in my life was made. A family member reached out to me and helped me network into my first job. He gave me a piece advice that I still parrot today. "Your personal network is your most valuable asset." Through his network, I landed a job at a startup in Dallas Texas.

The leap was scary. Everything and everyone I knew was in Illinois. Programming wasn't in my job description, but I was able to leverage my skills to help the company grow. About 9 months into the job, I spotted an ad for The Guildhall. With intrigue, I clicked on it. It was a new video game development program at SMU, and serendipitously, the program was located at an off-campus site minutes from my apartment. I never lost my interest in games, they serve as a way for my friends to hang out to this day. My undergrad GPA wasn't great, but I figured I'd shoot my shot, so I applied.

Once again, serendipitiously, I was accepted on academic probation. It turned out the program was brand new. To the best of my knowledge at that time, SMU Guildhall was one of three programs in the country, and the only accredited graduate program that targeted the video game industry. I was accepted to the seventh cohort of the program, and the school was looking to fill seats. I never worked so hard in my life. 

For the first in my life, I got great grades. Going into the program I thought I knew how to program, but I was wrong. It was now that I understood why I did so poorly in my interviews post undergrad. The Guildhall taught me to be an engineer. Our capstone project incorporated students from art, design, and engineering disciplines, and I was made the lead engineer. During school I interned at a studio back in Chicago, and I was offered a job upon graduation.

I was now a professional game developer! Let me tell you, there is something very rewarding seeing a video game you built sit on a shelf at a store. While I was building games, I didn't lose sight of leadership opportunties. Not long after establishing myself at the studio, I organized an indoor soccer team, and a men's softball team made up from employees of the studio. While my name is in the credits of a few titles, my time in video games didn't last beyond a few years.

The games industry is notoriously bad at managing work-life balance. By now I was a newly wed and working my dream job. Unfortunately I was working 80+ hours a week, and I was missing out on time with my wife. Networking for my next move, I reached back out to The Guildhall. To my surprise they linked me up with Haliburton. Turned out they were trying to leverage game technologies to do real-time well status monitoring. My wife and I found ourselves packing for Dallas.

At Haliburton I learned the difference in concerns when building entertainment products vs enterprise products. I gained valuable experience in how to manage the process of building software. My interest in better understanding business started to take root here. 

The combined engineering and process leadership quickly proved valuable with my next employer, Tyler Technologies. At the time of this writing, I have been with Tyler for over 10 years. I've been able to leverage my experience and leadership to help found the corporate development division, and lead the company through its cloud transformation.
