Last week I just graduated with my [Executive MBA from Southern Methodist University](https://www.smu.edu/cox/business-degrees/mba-programs/executive-mba). This two year investment went by incredibly quick, and my [second graduate stint](https://www.smu.edu/guildhall) with SMU. I worked hard and I am proud of my accomplishment and excited about the future. I want to take a moment to reflect on the journey.

An MBA is something I have been interested in for a long time.
