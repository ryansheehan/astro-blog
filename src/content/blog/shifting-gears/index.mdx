At the time of this writing, I am a little over a month away from graduating with my Executive MBA from SMU. As my last classes are wrapping up, I find myself at the precipice of a new chapter in my career. Two years ago, I decided to venture from my bubble of software development into the world of business.

Eventually, every software engineer has to decide about moving their career toward business leadership or technical leadership. While I have a special place in my heart for engineering, I decided to move toward the business side. My insatiable curiosity and thirst for knowledge, combined with my lack of business acumen, made the decision to pursue an MBA easy. One of the primary reasons I chose SMU was my success when I graduated from SMU with a master's professional certification in interactive entertainment engineering. I aim to combine my 15 years of experience building software with the knowledge I've gained from my EMBA to become a successful business leader in technology.

So why start a blog? This blog serves two main objectives for me. First, it is a place to reflect on my experiences and share my knowledge with others. I have a wealth of experience and knowledge; if it helps even one person, it is worth it. Written communication is something I can continuously improve on, and I can document my journey from engineer to business leader. As I'm actively seeking new opportunities, this blog will help me stand out.

Second, this website is a playground for me. A place to stay in touch with my engineering roots. I genuinely enjoy web development and don't want to lose touch with my hard-earned skills. It may not be a place of enterprise application development, but I can still have fun with it. I have had so many ideas over the years, and I hope that a few of them find their way to the internet, and this blog can document those journies as well.

It's scary to be vulnerable, step out of my bubble, and put myself out there. I'd love to hear your story if you've taken the leap from engineering to business. If you're considering it, I'd love to help you decide. If you're just here for the ride, I hope you enjoy the journey. I'm excited to see where this new chapter takes me.
